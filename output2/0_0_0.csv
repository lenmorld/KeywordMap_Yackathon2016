Montreal-Nord, QC H1G 3A2,Da Bologna,Da Bologna est véritablement le bijou de Montréal-Nord en matière de fast-food. Situé sur la rue Charleroi, ce restaurant offre toute une variété de sous-marin, de pizza, de pâtes et même de pizza-burger, une spécialité tout à fait délicieuse qui devrait être exportée. Les frites et les rondelles d'oignons sont très bonnes et faites sur place. En fait, tout sur le menu est très bon. Il faut simplement prévoir de l'argent en espèce pour payer, car ni les cartes de débits ni les cartes de crédits ne sont acceptés.

Montreal-Nord, QC H1G 3A2,Da Bologna,Good default order-in type of place.

A bit on the pricey side when you can get a 2 for1 pizza for $30, feeding a family of 4 will cost you about $15-$20 per person.

The food and delivery time are always spot-on. I've been a regular for the last 5 years, my last order was a few nights ago.

My favorite dish: the veal parmegiana with any pasta rose. All dressed pizza with extra mushrooms, well done. Yum!

Montreal-Nord, QC H1G 3A2,Da Bologna,A Montreal-North institution. I remember growing up in MTL-North and enjoying their amazing pizzas and subs. They still are amazing. Came here on a Saturday night with the guys and had to wait 20 minutes for a table but it was of course worth the wait.

I have to admit it has been a few years since I've been here. It was a little hole in the wall but they have renovated it nicely and now accept reservations.

Our usual waitress, Sophie, took great care of us. We ordered our subs (Bologna special for me, Steak, Steak and more Steak sub for buddy #1) while my other bud had a veal parm. All served hot and delicious. Such a treat to eat here. Never had one bad dish or service. They really take pride in their food and it shows. Ordered a small bacon pizza to go since my wife never had Bologna. She really enjoyed it! Oh before I forget try their onion rings, really crunchy and yummy.

Now fair warning to all. It is an Italian family style restaurant. It is loud, loud loud. It makes Elios pizzeria sound like a church. So just letting you know that no, there is not a huge fight happening in the resto, it is just us Italians enjoying conversation :-)

Montreal-Nord, QC H1G 3A2,Da Bologna,A few weeks back I was in Montreal for the Formula 1 race.  If you have been to Montreal you know that the amount of great food places is insane.  The places that you want to visit are the hidden gems and let me tell you Da Bologna is just that.  Its in Montreal North hidden in a small area surrounded with homes and small shops.  When approaching this place from the outside you might think twice about going inside.  If that crosses your mind DONT LISTEN to your self.  If the line up to get in doesn't give it away then please take my advise.  This place is awesomeeee.  I ordered the pizza of course which is what they are known for and let me tell you I could not find anything wrong with it even if I wanted to.  My biggest problem was trying not to steal my friends sub sandwich that is made from the pizza dough.  That looked amazing also.  Pizza is heavy on the toppings and cooked to perfection.

Please make sure to call for a reservation and even still be prepared to wait but its well worth the wait.

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,Stayed here for 2 nights with 2 girlfriends. Great location, only a short walk to the old district and another short walk to the bars (which was a focus for us girls on vacation together).

Rooms were adequate and clean and surprising quiet as there was a huge group of guys watching hockey in the room next to us and we never heard anything unless we were leaving the room and in the hallway. They had just changed over the mattresses on the floor so the mattress was nice and firm, rather than your usual holiday inn sagging.

Foyer was "interesting" had that YMCA pool smell to it, but we later noticed that there was a huge fish pond in the ground. Weird, didnt think fish liked chlorine.

We got a really really good rate (although parking is an additional $20 per night) and split between the 3 girls, meant we had extra money for spending on cocktails.

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,This is one of 3 Holiday Inns in the general Montreal area.  It is located on the edge of Chinatown but in an ideal location to walk to the Old Montreal area, or the Plateau section with the great restaurants, clubs, and bars.  Bars and clubs on Saint Catherine are also a short walk away.  

Booking was easy and I was assured the rooms would be ready as I had requested (one with a roll-away bed and one without), both rooms next to each other.  My train was late getting into Montreal and we had to check in almost toward 9PM the day of.  Bianca at reception was friendly and for the most part helpful but by the evening it appeared the hotel staff gave all the rooms with double beds away and therefore had nothing for me left, even though I reserved weeks in advance.  They had to give me one room from another reservation coming in the next day and a room with one King size bed two floors up.  No apology and no compensation for these inconveniences.  We also had to wait two hours for the roll away and my friend wanted to take a nap before we went out for the night.  

The second floor (which is the reception area, bar, and restaurant) has a nice in floor pond which you can walk through.  The rooms were decently sized.  One odd detail was that there were no ceiling lights, only lamps and the window.  

A/C filter needed to be replaced and was actually done by hotel staff while we were trying to get dressed at 8AM one morning.  Housekeeping was good and took care of my requests.  

Beds and showers were clean and everything but the television appeared new and was in working order.  

Underground parking garage and taxi stand in front which is convenient for the airport or to head somewhere further.  Place d'Armes Metro station is across the street.

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,I enjoyed staying at this location because it is close to Chinatown and diagonal from the Palais de Congres. It is quite clean in the rooms. The other benefits were the pool and jacuzzi. It doesn't seem like many people use these facilities because I was the only one there besides my husband!

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,Enjoyed my stay here last weekend. 

It's right in the middle ... 5 minutes from Old Montreal and then maybe 10-15 walk to St Catherines for shopping :P  

Rooms are clean and the bathroom was quite big so it's nice if you had to share the mirror for make up because there is usually never enough room for two people ... but in this hotel you're in luck.

I liked the concept of the lobby you can walk over to breakfast and dinner area over the water where the koi are swimming. 

We got a weekend special for $100 a night which included buffet breakfast.  I'm assuming they don't go these specials all the time so you have to keep an eye out for it. 

The only thing that bothered me was that the buffet in the morning was coldish.
Eggs, sausage and bacon were hot ... almost on the verge of cold. 
Other than that ... it was a pleasant stay.

And yes parking is $20 additional.

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,Friendly staff, super clean hotel, and very affordable for a downtown location that is very close to everything a traveler would want to see. My only complaint is the cheap pillows and uncomfortable beds.

Recommended though!

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,first the good things: It's right on top of a metro-station, and very convenient if you like to wander around old-town Montreal, China-town, or shopping on St. Catherine.
The breakfast buffet is nice, and the rooms are clean.

The bad things: It looks like the rooms were last renovated in the 70's. granted, I mean in the last century... 
it is very noisy, even on the executive floor. If somebody on your floor decides to make a long-distance phone-call in the middle of the night, you won't get any sleep.
The restaurant is closed Sundays and Mondays, and the food in the bar is a very poor substitute. However, worst of all was that they were not allowed to serve alcohol in either bar, or restaurant, because "we had to re-negotiate our liquor-license".... 
Maybe you should  be in a different business....

First, and last time I've ever stayed here.

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,Located in Montreal's Chinatown and close to Rue St. Catherine Est's nightlife, I stayed at this Holiday Inn during my second visit to Montreal. With clean rooms, Asian-inspired lobby, and affordable rates, I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Free Wi-Fi, reliable staff, and location all are positive points for this hotel. Recommended!

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,Holiday Inn Select was not my first choice when I was planning for 3 days trip to Montreal, but I just could not pass the "Sweet Deal" that offers by Montreal Tourism: half price for 2nd/3rd night, Free breakfast, Coupon books...etc...

The hotel though is really convenient as it is just across the street from Metro Station Place-d'Armes..hop on Metro and it can get you everywhere. Within walking distance to Old Montreal, St Catherines, St Denis.. if it is nice and warm, basically you can walk everywhere. 

The hotel itself though is dated. The Oriental theme is a little cheesy... but I guess since it is located in Chinatown. My Yelp Friend at first thought it is a temple from a distance then find out it is our hotel! 

No fridge in the room to cool my beers and wines, but you can get some ice at the machine on every floor.

The Parking though has in and out privileges is a little pricey at $25 and the underground lot is a little dark and spaces are tight.

Free WIFI works perfectly but you will need an access code to sign in.

I will stay here again if the price is right......

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,Great location! Right next to Chinatown and 10 mins walk from old city. Really enjoyed the fact that the bixi bikes were right across the street so if you're getting a day pass, you wont need to go far. 

I used my priority points for 2 rooms during my stay. Upon checking in, they told me only 1 of the rooms were ready so I checked myself in the ready room and left the other room for my friends who were coming late. Little did I know the room that wasn't ready was the PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. What?!!!!! Reception did not tell me that, NOT COOL. So I ended up giving the suite to my friends who wasted it. Didn't invite anyone up for a party and it was in immaculate condition the next morning as if they didn't even stay. 

The rooms overall are nice and clean. It's the holiday inn so I didn't expect much and it exceeded my expectations. 

Also in the lobby, theres a nice koi pond (the quality of the koi is another story). 

2 thumbs down for their breakfast buffet. $18 CAD for crappy food, way overpriced. I recommend walking over to Olive & Gourmando (5 minutes) for their awesome selection of... everything

Oh yea, and free WIFIS!

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,Great location close to china town and a short walk to old town. The fun ended there. First we were not aware of $26 per day for parking. Second the curtains in the room did not close to block out any light. Found an old muffin in the closet. Really old, dried out. Lamp didn't work etc etc. Really disappointed for a hotel with good reviews and an advertised 4 star rating. It's a 2 star at best. The hotel staff did make things Right and the beds were really comfortable. I'd stay here again.

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,Definitely not bad for what we paid, about $100 per night including tax, and during Bal en Blanc weekend too. The positives: as close as you could possibly get to the subway (Place d'Armes Station), HOT water and lots of it, multilingual staff, clean rooms, in Chinatown, safe area, and a hop, skip, and jump away from Vieux Port. Negatives: Old room... it desperately needed a new dresser, no fridge, PACKED pool and jacuzzi (we tried to go twice without luck), weird smell of baby powder in our room for the first night, and expensive parking $26 a day??? We ended up parking in a complex just before the hotel and it cost us $18 for 3 days!

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,Staff was on lockout upon arrival we had to cross a picket line. Angry staff members yelling and clanging bells as u walk in... It is located right beside fire hall so we heard fire engines all night. It is also located beside a park which was overrun in homeless people, the view from my window was of the homeless people drinking. No lunch or dinner service and had to go to front desk for towels as their was no maid service.

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,Stay here every year or two for four or five days. Yes, it's a bit dated - can't wait for the 2015 renovations! But it is clean, the prices are very reasonable, the front desk is very helpful, and if there is any problem, they are quick to respond. 
Great location at edge of Chinatown, across from a Metro station, and a short walk to Old Montreal.
A particular rave for Pierre at the front desk. He has been there since the 90s and is friendly, helpful, and more than willing to go the extra mile. Place was packed when we arrived and he immediately offered two chits for wine while we waited for our room to be readied.

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,In terms of the hotel itself, I found it to be great and would give you 5 stars if it had not been for the unacceptable behavior of one of your staff. On the last day of my stay, my experience was marred by the disrespectful treatment of one of your employees.

On Monday July 14th, at 6am, I was waiting for my parents by the entry stairs. I had my luggage so I was clearly a patron at your hotel. I asked one of your young male employees where the restrooms were. I was told very rudely that I could go use the ones across the street and that I would have to wait outside. I informed him I was waiting for my parents. He then went into the vestibule and rudely told some Asian women that they'd have to go wait outside.

Some Caucasian people then approached him with a question and I heard a different and courteous tone when he assisted them. 

I then asked him if there were restrooms on the 2nd floor and he reluctantly said yes. Why did he not tell me so in the first place? I felt discriminated against. I am paying for your hospitality, why should I have to go across the street to use the restrooms? I felt so humiliated and appalled that I did not think to ask for his name, which I regret. He is lucky I had to leave, otherwise I would have spoken to the manager about his racist attitude. His behavior was completely unacceptable, especially considering he is working in Chinatown.

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,Fairly-priced hotel. Met my expectations. Rooms are quite large, 2 queens in the room plus extra space to dance in while you get ready. All the basic services; rooms get cleaned, pool on the 3rd floor,  staff is courteous.

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,Though this hotel is a bit dated, their location is great. Btw- it's scheduled for a full remodel soon. Their staff is very helpful and friendly. Very good & pricy Chinese food in their restaurant; but their servers seem tired and uninterested. We were only in town for 2 nights, so the price was right, even with $27 per night self-parking fee, which is less than most other locations. It's not fancy, but the room was comfy and very clean.

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,My friend was the one who booked the stay here for us. When I heard we were during staying at the Holiday Inn my reaction was "lol..k then?".  When we arrived I was pleasantly surprised. I don't frequent Holiday Inns, but the impression of a clear fish pond (although they should seek some advice on how to properly care for those fish as most of them seemed lethargic and sick. Not exactly a super pleasant sight) and relaxing atmosphere with stones and plants with a seating area. Staff was helpful and friendly although we did not interact with them for anything other than to check in/out and there were no issues. 
Room was clean and nicer than expected. Comfy bed and pillows. Sheets, blankets, towels etc all seemed clean...room smelled clean. I assume this is post reno. However the pool and gym are lacking. The pool area smells like chlorine so its "smells" appropriate however appearances made me uneasy.  The pool is small and dirty. The hot tub is very dirty. Black gunk on tiles and black and brown gunk growing inside the filter intake and water jets...the warning sign "enter at your own risk" has a new meaning here. The gym was the tiniest I've ever seen... One treadmill? Just a bit awkward, but whatever...I didn't stay for the pool and gym anyway. Overall a pretty good place to crash.

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,Great location for access to the Metro Orange line Place D'Armes station. Clean and comfortable room. Parking is $27/ day which I think is too expensive. If the plan is to leave it parked for the duration of your stay, there is a lot a block away that is cheaper. I found this hotel a good home base in our travels around Montreal. We were here more specifically for the Montreal Grand Prix Formula One race, and it was very easy to get to the track and back. There is one transfer from the orange line to the yellow line but it was not a difficult commute.

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,Good central location that is a 5-20 min walk to most everything you would want to see/do in downtown Montreal.  On the edge of Chinatown so you can enjoy late night dining options. The area has just a little bit of a dirty/run down vibe but that's typical of most Chinatown areas I've seen --- felt safe. Hotel has Chinese theme that is a bit cheesy. Rooms are updated on this aging building with decent beds but still constrained by that older traditional room layout. Pool and sauna whirlpool showing its age but usable - hot tub not hot enough. Bar and restaurant pretty dead and lackluster - food pretty mediocre. You really want to stay here for the good location at a reasonable price with a good staff.   Tip: if you are comfortable on a bike, pay $5 a day for the automated city bike rental stations and get around everywhere cheap and fast! It was the best part of our visit!

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,The only good thing about this place was the free wifi which worked fast. It is also in a good central location to old Montreal and downtown. 
Otherwise, our room was dark, dingy and smelled like smoke. There is a $27 parking free that isn't listed on their website or at least in a place that is easily seen. The room plus parking for one night was almost $200.. We have stayed elsewhere for less and had a much better experience.

Montreal, QC H2Z 1E9,Holiday Inn Montreal Centreville Downtown,Went here for a wedding reception. The generally followed the standard fare for a Chinese banquet (i.e. 9 courses, etc.), although it was poorly done. Among the many wedding receptions i have attended, I would have to rate the food here to be the worst I've experienced. Several dishes come to mind: 
1. the fried rice dish included large chucks of rice. Little care was taken in its preparation. 
2. The "shark fin soup" tasted stale. 
3. Shitake mushrooms in a vegetable dish were extremely chewy, which means they did not rehydrate them enough, or used very low quality mushrooms.
4. Crab claws were tiny - the ones offered at local dim sum places are twice the size. 
5. Red bean soup was loaded with sugar....and little else. 

The service was equally bad:

1. As a waiter came by to offer wine, I asked for white. He only had red, and he said he'd come by later. A few minutes later, they took away my glass.
2. Food was served family style - the wait staff took away the plates without offering guests any remaining food. Even when guests told the waitstaff that the table wasn't finished with the dish, the waitstaff ignored them and still took the dish away. 
3. Only changed our dishes once throughout the meal - normally this is done several times.
4. Some tables never received cake, whereas at other tables cake was "served" twice. These twice-served tables had no one sitting at them, which made it easy for the waiters to simple leave the plates there...
5. According to the bride, her own father at the head table wasn't served certain dishes since the waiter simply forgot.

For anyone planning their wedding reception here, I advise you to tread carefully. It was unfortunate that the bride and groom received such poor quality food and service from Holiday Inn, though they did try to make the best of it. For such an important day, they deserved better.

Montreal, QC H2B 1L4,Gourmet D'asie,It's not bad.. but it's also not great. The Imperial rolls very tasty and the peanut dipping sauce it came with was REALLY good but after that, the whole meal was "meh". The wonton soup was tasteless and came with a bunch of extra noodles at the bottom of the bowl, the stir fry veggies with chicken, beef and shrimp on a bed of noodle was more a soup than anything else. Not to mention the plate it came in would always make the "sauce" over flow. It was messy. 
Apparently the General Tao chicken was FANTASTIC as well as the peanut butter chicken with crispy spinach. I didn't try it but the individuals who did were quite pleased (and didn't have to fight with their plate).

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,Woohoo... I'm the first to review! 

I was a bit hesitant about staying here since the reviews on other sites were mixed, however I found this hotel to be great and suitable to our needs. For anyone that is concerned about the construction, there should be no worries. The construction is really just a renovation that is confined to just the lounge/bar area. No noise or dust anywhere. The staff were friendly and extremely accommodating. The manager hooked us up with a room upgrade to a suite room! We also received a lot of great recommendations on where to sight-see (Parc du Mont-Royal) and where to drink/eat (Weinstein and Gustovino's). 

Our suite room (Room 1000) is modern and nicely laid out. There were several issues that we did notice, however did not really bother us all that much: No hairdryer (front desk asked us to look in the cabinet under the sink, but it was a pedestal sink!), the bed was VERY firm and the linens a bit rough for my silky smooth skin. Oh, and just a side note, there were spiders on the exterior of the building; no possible way of getting in, but did anyone else notice that all of Montreal is just crawling with spiders all over the place??? 

Parking was a bit odd. Hotel guests have to park in P-9/P-10 which is 9/10 flights below (we got a bit dizzy going in circles). The elevator is right there, although it only goes as far up to the Food Court level. You then have to walk up a flight of stairs to the lobby to check-in. Because of this set up, there is no one to help you with your luggage if you do self parking. Odd. 

Overall, I really enjoyed staying here and would gladly stay here again. The neighborhood is a bit dead during the weekends, however the Metro is right in the candy-land convention center across the street and everything is within a 10 minute walk.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,I really loved this hotel. When I graduated high school I got an all expenses paid trip to Montreal and this hotel was part of the package. 

This hotel was much fancier that what I am used to, so clearly I was impressed with just about everything. One problem I generally have with hotels [nice or not] is feeling comfortable in the beds and with the pillows. However, the mattress was perfect, not to hard, not too soft. And the pillows were great as well, they had tons of them, some super soft, some a little firm, and a couple hard ones. I found what suited me best and had absolutely no problems sleeping. 

The bathroom was lovely as well, we had a jacuzzi tub and a rather typical shower but we thoroughly enjoyed both! 

The concierge service was fantastic. I had been to Montreal a couple times before but since this time I was with a friend we were looking for anything crazy we could get into. The person we spoke with was completely committed to making sure we knew exactly where we were going, how we were going to get there, and what to expect. This hotel is in a great location and my friend and I felt comfortable walking to all the hot spots we wanted to hit. 

Check out was a breeze, parking was not. Like Michael said, the parking garage was a bit of a maze, but other than that I really enjoyed this hotel!

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,I recently found myself facing a birthday milestone of sorts, so like any level-headed person, I chose escapism to avoid any office brouhahas and off-key singing. By pure happenstance, I wound up at this InterContinental (it was part of an Expedia package), but let me tell you -- it was a week of pure heaven. First of all, you're just steps from Old Town, so surrounded by breathtaking architecture. It's conveniently Metro-adjacent, flawlessly decorated, and staffed with service-oriented professionals who spoil you rotten. I literally wanted to have my bed, park view, and luxurious bathroom shipped home with me. While this hotel stay was not of my choosing when I booked my trip, you can rest assured I'll now be purposely staying at this chain again and again.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,Great hotel with spacious, tastefully decorated rooms. It is located just a few seconds away from two subway stops, Place D'armes or Place Victioria and is located in the financial district of the city near the Old City.

The lobby is connected to two restaurants, Osco and Sarah B's Absinthe Lounge and there is also a coffee shop downstairs called Java U. 

The hotel is very quiet, quite fancy and the concierge was wonderful and extremely knowledgeable. If the weather isn't great you can take the back exit and access a tunnel that will connect you to the subway without having to set foot outside which is also pretty neat. The back exit also features an arcade where there is a convenience store, a couple of small restaurants and a few random shops. I had a wonderful stay there in this hotel.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,I recently stayed at IC with my spouse.  We stayed a few days following a conference.  

I would like to highlight the outstanding work of your concierge - Chantal Aubry.   Ms. Aubry helped us out when we were looking for places to eat and recommended a few excellent choices.  Her service was prompt and upbeat.  She was a pleasure to deal with.  And her choices were exactly what we were looking for.   When we had a special request which should could not answer on the spot - she indicated she would call our room with the information later that day.  She fulfilled her promise, and called us later with yet another superior recommendation.  

Ms. Aubry embodies fine customer service and is one of the reasons for a great experience.

It was a pleasure to stay at IC, and we look forward to returning sometime in the future.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,This hotel has a very welcoming lobby with a huge curved couch and (faux?) fur lined walls.  The staff were all very accomodating and the room was incredibly comfortable.  I appreciated the free wi-fi and the plug-ins on the bedside table lamps.

I would have enjoyed a deeper bathtub but liked that I could turn up the separate heat in the bathroom.  The breakfast room was very small and that caused a line-up in the morning.  We weren't given menus so assumed the buffet was the only option.  It wasn't great and was $25!  Yikes.  It was pretty close to 5 stars for sure.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,We were there for only one night - as a resident of Montreal I don't really stay in hotels here.  The lobby is nice and the service is helpful and friendly.  The room was nice enough and the bed very comfy.  We had the buffet brunch the next day which I thought was so so.  Pretty much standard fare and was included in the deal we got for the room. If I had to pay $25 for that I would have been pissed.  My only real complaint, and this is for the hotel industry in general - why are they charging $7 for a bottle of water?  You'd think they'd give it as a courtesy.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,I have stayed at this hotel about a dozen times over the past couple of years (2008-2011) and I definitely am a fan. More so a fan probably, since I usually stay for business and the company forks out the $ for me to stay here. 

Rooms are fairly large and immaculate! Bathrooms include a stand alone shower and tub off to the side, telephone on the wall next to the potty for those long conversations one has while going to the loo (kidding), and a great speaker system  built into the wall so you can continue to listen to the television show you may have been watching while you shower or go to the bathroom. Fully stocked with towels, toilet paper, and other bathroom essentials. 

Hotel is close to old Montreal, but other than that, if you're younger and looking to bar hop, I would suggest staying elsewhere, I 'think' this hotel is closer to the business district so think 'concrete' jungle for the most part. Nice restaurant within the hotel. 

Would i stay here again? For sure. As long as I was on business and just looking for a comfortable place to stay.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,First thing: do sign up for the Intercontinental Club upgrade! $10 a day is well worth it. It comes with included breakfast and afternoon tea in their lounge.

The room we got is beautiful, facing towards the fountain in the complex across, overlooking the multi-coloured glass walled convention center. Very well decorated. This being a business class hotel, did not have amenities such as a microwave which would have been most helpful for families with young kids.

Location-wise, it is great. 10-15 minutes walk to downtown shopping areas, to the Chinatown area and to the old port area. It is also in between two Metro stations, Square-Victoria and Place D'Armes. A short ride from the Biodome/Olympic Park and to LaRonde.

This hotel is also right on top of one part of the Underground City, which features shops along the number of connected Metro stations.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,Back to La Belle Ville!

Having grown up in Montreal but not lived there for 20yrs, I always look forward to heading back...especially when work is paying! Hazaaah! And while I was looking forward to my stay at the IM, I was rather disappointed with several elements. Let's just say that my mom runs a way tighter ship. 

List of grievances:

- Hidden charges: these were everywhere! Tax and surcharge for room service, no prices anywhere for mini bar (yes, i assumed it was pricey but full disclosure is preferred). Also, who doesn't have free wi-fi these days!?!? Their charge of $10 for 2h is unheard of. Luckily we got a code as part of our meeting but not after a few people had already ponied up the cash.  

- Low quality products: first off, the remote in my room was infuriating! very hard to switch channels, increase volume and sometimes the remote ghost woudl take over and change channels when all I wanted was to mute it for a second. Very bizarre. Also, the towels in the bathrooms were like sandpaper. And i'm not being precious here...they were really rough. Also, it looked like the bathroom hadn't had a good upkeep in years. Paint chips and caulking coming off the bathtub. Verging on ghetto.

- Slightly crusty staff: i had to print out 1 page, sign and fax back to Vancouver during the meeting. I couldn't really believe how crusty the woman was at the desk about it. They like to hold meetings there so isn't this a common request? She could have just told me that the meeting would be charged to use the business center and sent me on my way. Wasn't too sure why it was an issue.

- General cheeziness: i'm not sure if this is a bad thing. One thing about us Quebecois is we like our cheese and not only in curd format. This hotel was clearly designed in the 1990s with it's lobby decked out in faux fur walls, sequins and feathered pillows. Or maybe it was designed last week. That's just a Quebec thing. But it is VERY cheesy. Including the ads for the absinthe bar with the promise of seductive red lips and the green genie. It put me off a bit but then I remembered my roots and just got into it. If you like nouveau chique and modern design this isn't your place though. You've been warned. 

All in all, I think the Coast in Nanaimo is better which is kinda sad when you consider the international level of travelers going through Montreal. I would expect service level to be much higher. But it is walking distance to Old Montreal, Chinatown, downtown and St-Laurent so for the price, probably worth a look.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,We've stayed in two other Montreal hotels in the past 2 years, so we had some basis for comparison when staying here.  I chose the Intercontinental for its proximity to the old town and the fact that it had a special rate through the Montreal tourism site.  Upon arrival on a Saturday evening, we were able to park on the street for free (it was after 6) which allowed us easy access to the hotel.  We were told we had been "upgraded" to a room with a view.  And what a view!  We were on the 24th floor for two nights.  The room was spacious and clean.  The king size bed was super comfy- the pillows were ridiculously soft, which may not be for everyone.  The bathroom was big, too, as it had a small shower with good water pressure AND a tub.  And I will mention- as it matters to me- that the hairdryer provided was awesome.  

Generally, this hotel is great, though wi-fi and breakfast cost extra unlike many hotel deals in Montreal.  We didn't take advantage of the pool or the business center which I suppose are two of the other perks of the hotel.  Generally, stay here if you can find a good deal.  Otherwise, you may be like us and need less and therefore can stay somewhere with free wi-fi.

The concierge and staff are have always been great to me when I have stayed here.  They are also very accommodating and friendly.   

The rooms are pleasing and comfortable. Laying on the bed too long will make you want to take a nap. 

My only complaint is lack of free WiFi and overpriced minibar.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,This is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Old Montreal, within a couple of blocks of Saint-Catherine shopping and the Place Des Arts.  I stayed here for one night on pleasure.  It's worth noting that I stayed with a Living Social coupon for $185/night plus tax, which is essentially 50% off.  I also know other travellers who have gotten a room for $200/night on Priceline.com.  I would NOT pay the $300-$350/night they ask on the website as full-price.

That being said, they gave us a beautiful, larger corner room.  There wasn't much view (other than the windows of adjacent buidlings), but the room was luxurious, with a nice, large washroom (including separate standing shower and bathtub).  Service was excellent, and I have no complaints.

While people seem to complain about the expensive wifi, I was able to use wifi for free while in my room.  It switched to a pay-policy when in the lobby or restaurants.  Not sure why...

The hotel also has a fantastic restaurant (Osco!), and a fun absinthe bar (Sarah B.).

I would recommend this restaurant, assuming you can get a deal on the room price.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,Great location. Reserved a "deluxe room with magnificent view", but the view was lackluster. Bathroom was huge though. Very comfy bed. Lobby is not that impressive.
The front desk was slow and there wasn't a PriorityClub line available, bummer. Concierge was top notch though, spent a good 20 minutes telling us all the places to go and writing it down on a map for us. 

Next time, I would consider staying at the W better which is right next door. Geared more towards the younger crowd.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,Neither myself nor my partner had ever been to Montreal before.  I know, I know.

This hotel was a great jumping off place for us to get situated & learn our bearings of the city.  It's right down the block from the Square-Victoria metro stop (& technically you don't even have to go outside to get there!  You can utilize an underground passage.)  It's also close to Vieux-Port & Old Montreal.

The lobby itself included faux fur, sequins, & zebra print.  It was...err, interesting.

No free wifi - $10 for two hours or $15 for a day.  Seemed a bit skimpy in comparison to the image they were presenting otherwise.

The water pressure in the shower was excellent.  Why have I been settling for subpar pressure in our own apartment washroom?

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,We booked on Hotwire, so we weren't exactly sure what we were going to get for a hotel.  Its ratings were pretty high, though, so we were semi-confident in our decision.  We really lucked out!  

Upon entering one of the doors to the hotel (and especially parking underground), It was a little confusing to try to weave your way to the front desk, but there were many magnificent views along the way.  The lobby (and hallways) are beautifully decorated with a retro modern look.  The elevators to the rooms are quick, plentiful, and very clean.  Upon entry into our room, my jaw dropped.  For a hotel room, it was HUGE.  The decor was updated and very welcoming.  The king-size bed was still dwarfed by the room, and it was oh-so-comfortable after a day of exploring Montreal on foot.  There was also a reading chair and ottoman, mini-bar, and large flat-screen TV in the room, and there was still a lot of leftover space!  The closet was also huge.  The bathroom was very clean, marbled, and luxurious as well.  The towels weren't super soft, but that can be overlooked with everything else that the room had going for it.  There's also a phone in the bathroom should you need one (but, really, why would you?).  We felt very pampered and slept SO well in this comfortable, clean, quiet room.  I wished we had a longer stay. :(  

Off the lobby, there's a coffee shop called Java U that serves a plethora of breakfast/lunch choices at very reasonable prices.  We didn't get a chance to try out the bar or other dining options, but they looked very nice.  

Underground parking is convenient, but a bit pricey here.  It's $20+ per time you exit and/or day, so make sure you only go out once a day if you're going to drive anywhere!  We walked to most places downtown, took the hop-on, hop-off bus tour, and/or jumped on the Metro subway.  (There's a entry to the Underground just across the street from the hotel.  There may even be a connection from the hotel.  It's big enough and we never did explore everything.)  

The hotel was in a good location, too.  It wasn't right amongst the downtown attractions, but it's only a short walk away, and we loved the exercise.  

We'd definitely consider staying here again on a future visit to Montreal; it'll probably be the first place we check out when booking again.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,My husband and I stayed here for our ten-year anniversary and had a fantastic time.  He told them ahead of time that it was a special occasion for us, and they really went out of their way to make it special for us!  They left cupcakes in our room and gave us a room with a spectacular view of the city.  The room was small but immaculately clean.  We received great service with regard to our every concern.  The hotel concierge was sweet and VERY helpful with regard to all our event planning.  Perhaps our favorite part in staying here was the incredible buffet breakfast - you must try it!  A phenomenal selection of delicious foods, and the crepes and fresh omelets were especially to die for.  Finally, you just can't beat the location!  We couldn't recommend this hotel more highly.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,It was a nice hotel. Great location. It has access to RESO, the underground tunnels that gets you around without having to be outside in the cold.

The room was great. Wallpaper in bathroom was peeling off, so it was kind of gross. There was a phone next to the toilet, that was kind of weird. 

The staff was really nice, friendly, and helpful. The environment was really nice except for when I stumbled onto two drunk girls with little clothing on, one without shoes, and one with only socks.

I didn't go into the restaurant because of the cost, but it smelled really really really good.

Getting to your car is kind of a pain since their parking was in the sub level 9 and 10.

Check- in was straight forward and the staff was friendly to a non-French speaking guest. I came a few days early to take in the city and it was a good location. It was between two Metro stops and close to the Old Port. The concierge was fantastic and had good tips for places to dine as well as shop. They also made reservations for you for places that were more difficult to get in to. I would stay here again.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,Spent 2 nights at InterContinental to kick off a nice weekend in Montreal.

The location is great, right across Palais des Congres, and 2 Metro stops, and the Old Port and Chinatown is right there too.

In the Hotel there's Java-U cafe downstairs, Sarah B's Absinthe lounge, and Osco a high end Restaurant ; both on the Second floor up the escalator glidding up the Birch and Fur lined walls .  

The Bag check guys are on the bottom floor and the lobby to check in is on the 2nd floor. This check in was the worst I've ever seen! There are 1or 2 people checking you in, and the line is crazy long. The 3 days I stayed there , I don't think I Didn't see people waiting in line for something, that crazy!! 

I thought the decor was modern-fun, there were fresh Lilly flowers, and big couch to chill on. It did remind me of a Vegas Hotel.  And off the lobby is meeting rooms and conference Center with lots of boutiques and shops, pharmacy, infinity pond, giant chandelier ALL Inside.
 I even saw a wedding held there one night.

 My fiancé surprised me with a sweet. The bathroom was nice, marble in the showers around the bathtub. There's a portable map hanging on the bathroom door of how to walk/jog to the Old Port and back, with your choice of different routes based on distance. I thought that was thoughtful and I took advantage of it.   The TV was a nice Samsung flatscreen, and the stereo system plays throughout, even in the bathroom there are speakers. Rees a Kureg one-cup coffee maker which made awesome Van Houtte coffee, and green tea.  There was a desk, two chairs, and a little table it was a cute room set-up.  The bed was super comfy and the comforter  ( they keep you hot in winter and cool in the summer) was Plush.

One morning we asked to have the room cleaned before we returned from breakfast and a walk, and the room was not made. We had to ask addition times, and no apology.

The gym was good, they had all the equipment needed for a good workout. They do charge for water (3-6$), or offer the Water-fountain, the girl working the desk was rude and couldn't care less to say 'hi, welcome, bye, or have a nice day' . The second day there was a nicer guy and he offered workout towels and greeted us and asked if we needed anything.

We checked out the pool , it smelled soo strongly of chlorine I thought it would bleach my hair by just walking through the room. Outside of the pool wanted to hit the Sun Deck to get some sun one day, and there was a group of 5 partiers, there goes that idea! It was Tiny! Like a balcony really with a couple of trees.

It was disappointing to have a great Hotel not meet the expectations or standards of customer service of other high end Hotels.   There are waaaay better Hotels around Montreal for a better price, or higher end Hotels that treat you amazing and it's worth it. I left this place feeling cheated, and disappointed.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,Location is ok for exploring Old Montreal and the business district. A little less optimal for Plateau and Parc areas. The rooms are a little tired, not that I really mind usually but for 4 stars +? The lobby however, is very.... Florida contemporary?

To be honest, I was most disappointed with all of the additional fees. I booked on Priceline and I understand that the confusion might lie there, but still. Requested two beds and was told at check in that two beds would be an additional fee. Self park, additional fee. We brought our pet, additional fee. Wifi? fee! Bottled water - fee! I understand that often there are fees but there was no mention of it, or even the potential fees via Priceline OR the Intercontinental's own site. Once all was said and done we paid almost double per night than I had expected. The staff reduced the fees a little but I was annoyed. After a very long drive and a late evening check in, I was not in the mood. And no, you are not ALWAYS charged for your pet. We have stayed at plenty of hotels where there was no additional fee (I love you Ritz Carlton.) 

Really enjoyed the cleaning lady on the 11th floor though, she was lovely. 

In the end it was fine, but too expensive once you added everything up. We stayed at the Omni the year before for $60 less or so per night, and we had a wonderful room.

Plenty of features. Concierge was helpful. Restaurants within hotel. Metro without leaving building. 

Room was spacious. We had a king intimate (only slept two people) and it was very nice. No view however from the window despite being on the 17th floor it overlooked another room just across the way. 

Shower had two nozzles for extra warmth. Bathroom scale (to keep track of those extra vacation pounds) and a nice sitting chair. 

Parking was expensive and a hassle to get to car. Park on st Jacques street and parking is 17$ instead of 23 daily if you are staying for a while.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,My friend and I stayed here for Labor Day weekend.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful.  The decor is very contemporary and the architecture near the lobby is very interesting.  The rooms are clean and have adequate spacing.  However, WiFi nor continental breakfast is included (like it is at the Embassy Suites next door).  The hotel offers free WiFi for an hour during your stay AND the hotspot is located in the lobby!  I have to say, that made my stay inconvenient.  I have stayed in several hotels all over the United States both high end and not so high end, and they all came with free WiFi.  

Bottom line: Stay somewhere else, where all amenities are included with no additional fees!

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,I've got major beef with ANY establishment that charges $16/day for WiFi. It's 2013, people! C'mon! You can do better than that. I've stayed in cheap motels that offer free wifi. Especially for an international traveler, wifi is super important, and paying $16 per day for something that *should* be FREE really grinds my gears. Now that my rant is out of the way, the hotel was decent. Nothing special. The concierge desk NEVER picked up the phone when I called from the room which was semi-annoying. But overall, not a bad place to stay in Montreal.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,Introduction

This hotel is centrally located, but I got a ride from the airport (which by the way, is not far). There is valet parking and when I arrived, you have to go up an escalator to check-in. It appears this hotel is attached to a mall (?) or inside complex which is very convenient. My boyfriend had checked in the night before so all I had to do was go up. Elevators are near the hotel's main restaurant.

Room 1906

Our room was a nice corner "suite." It was sizeable and the bathroom was really huge. We didn't stay in the room that much but it was comfortable. Signature flat-screen tv, sitting area, safety deposit box, two closets (nice for extra space) and mini-bar. I wasn't too keen on the bathroom products (it said something about San Francisco) and while I usually love the smell of Lemon Verbena, these products weren't up to snuff. They didn't pass the "Charlotte takes all the products home" test.

Amenities

This hotel has a pool, gym, and spa. The hotel site makes the pool look nice and long, which is perfect for lap swimming. But because there is so much to do and see in Montreal, my boyfriend and I hardly got to use any of the facilities

One main restaurant and one lounge/bar. My friends and I (we stayed at the same hotel) decided to check out this bar and it wasn't too bad. Another review on that.

Valet Parking available. Every time we wanted to go out, we had to call the Concierge to get our car ready. I had slight issues with this as every time I called, there was no one at the Concierge desk. I had to try multiple times, only to call the Front Desk to get my car. 

Conclusion

I came here with my boyfriend and because he is an IHG member, he stayed here for the points. Overall, I didn't have the best impression of this hotel. Nothing special, nothing out of the ordinary; it's just a place to stay. There was one day when we left at 10AM, returned back at midnight, only to find that our room had not been cleaned at all. The day before, it was cleaned at around 6pm when we were getting ready to go out. This inconsistency for me is a big no-no. Two star deductions (and no, we didn't leave the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on). Staff aren't really friendly either, but perhaps I wasn't being friendly to them?

Location can't be beat. When one is in Montreal, you don't expect to lounge in the hotel anyways, so really, the InterContinental is just a place to crash. But on that note, I am sure there are cheaper options if you want a just-to-crash hotel. For the price you are paying, there are some expectations.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,We used Hotwire to try to get this Hotel, and succeeded. The trick is pay attention to their trip advisor rating and cross reference it with their star rating. anywho.. 

1- Room: They gave us a really nicely sized room, on a high floor with a large bathroom.- which some Hotels don't tend to do with Hotwire reservations, or usually try to give you the bare minimum. 

2- Location:  It's a nice little downtown neighborhood of "Vieux-Montreal" which is old Montreal. The restaurants around the block are pretty nice, and you'll find an assortment of traditional French cuisine. 


3- Transportation: There's a Metro Station connected to the Hotel in the "Montreal World Trade Center" annex thingy


4- Staff: Sweet, Kind and speak English- which came in handy for my better half

5- Amenities:

- Pool: Was ok, but not what I expected out of IHG
- Sauna:  Needs a little update
- Gym: Needs a little TLC and update as well

6- On site restaurant: Do not eat at the restaurant- unless you're starved and everything is close. The food is mediocre and priced as you'd expect at an IHG Hotel. The Absinte Bar, on the other hand is a must. The drinks are amazing, and quite potent. The bartender is really sweet and cordial. 


Overall, I did enjoy my stay at IHG, and would recommend it. However, I think they need to update their "spa."


TIP: Signup for their rewards program (it's free) and they'll waive the price of their $15/night WIFI. 

----
BONUS: Oddity of the "Montreal World Trade Center." The Hotel is right next to the St James Hotel and the area between them is enclosed to create some sort of retail/fast-food/ fine dining/ office spaces? It's nice during the winter - when we went- because they attempt give the allure of the outdoors inside. You must check it out.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,This hotel has a very nice manager. I booked it for a birthday weekend for my husband and his buddies. I didn't realize I hadn't booked double beds until the night before. Although they couldn't accommodate since the rooms were sold out, they offered kings with sofa beds. I wanted to cancel after the time limit and the manager did this for me with no fees or penalties. This is enough to make me want to stay here next time!!

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,Easily the most luxurious hotel I've ever stayed in.  There are a lot of options for lodging on our long weekend getaways to Montreal, but we keep coming back here.  It is a large international chain, so yes, it does lack the charm of a boutique hotel, but when I can score a room here for a scant $120/night over a holiday weekend, it's hard to argue.  

The rooms have what I'll call an understated regal quality, with deep reds and gold motif.  They're fairly spacious and can offer some very nice city views.  Our first stay here our room overlooked the park just outside next to the very colorful Palais des Congrés de Montreal.  The bathroom was amazing with a large tub and separate glass door shower.  The shower was not quite big enough for two (scandalous!) but looked fabulous.  I'm also a fan of the bath products and make sure to ask for extras to take home.  The brand is Agraria and it's their lemon verbena scent.  I'm generally not too into scents, but I love using this shampoo, it just smells so damn invigorating. 

Our second stay we were given an interior room overlooking the glass rooftop of the enclosed corridor between the hotel and the building behind it along with glimpses of the river in the background.  Not as good, but still nice and considering the price we paid, no complaints here.  I was slightly disappointed on our second visit to not have a room with separate tub and shower and instead, one with a very standard combo with a curtain.  Room #2 just wasn't as elegant as room #1.  Maybe we were upgraded our first time and just didn't know it?

The lobby is large, with a decent amount of seating and some interesting decor.  I also love the faux fur panels on the wall as you go down the escalator and the black and white plates displayed on the wall near the bar area.  Check-in has always been painless, though this may have a lot to do with arriving close to 10 pm each time, having driven up from the Boston area.  Staff is very much bilingual, so English-only speakers should have no issues.

The location is great, as it's very close to all your major tourist stuff in Old Montreal, shopping (or other activities) along St Catherine, not to mention, you can get on the Metro without setting foot outside.  Parking is not cheap, I believe $25/night for self park, or $35 or valet.  If you plan to do any driving around, do the valet, as the hourly parking fee applies each time you go in and out, a lesson I learned the hard way once.  Of course, this past trip we opted for valet and never use the car once, wasting $30 over the course of three nights.  Oh well, c'est la vie!

It is centrally located...closer to old town, has an indoor pool, spa, sauna, and exercise room with a few machines.

Internet is available for free in the lobby but if you join their club, no free to join, the Internet will also be free in your room. It is a beautiful hotel (which by the way doesn't look like from the outside). Don't expect a magnificent view from the window...but who cares. The hop on hop off bus is a couple of blocks away.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,We stayed here for 4 days while we were in town. It is good walking distance to Old Montreal, Downtown and many attractions. 20 minute drive to the oratory, would be over an hour walk on a nice day but was cold and rainy during our stay. The hotel was well appointed and our room was very well kept with a large bathroom. The concierges Gary and Jemil were extremely knowledgeable and had great recommendations for the city. Gary made sure our itineraries were confirmed and that we were on time for everything and Jemil made sure we were well fed and made us reservations at great places. He also helped me find a 24 hours pharmacy when I had a late night emergency and everything I could find was closed. The desk staff was super helpful, the cleaning staff were prompt. The only time they were delayed, we had the do not disturb sign on the room until shortly after 10 am and we were back to the room at 4 to rest and they were cleaning so we went to the rooftop patio to relax until they were done. They are not mind readers and I did not expect them to clean the room the moment we left especially when they had completed servicing the other rooms on our floor, so I think that was reasonable. Our only complaint was that the pool was quite small and has short hours. We have never been to hotel with a pool that closes at 7pm before and it did not give us any time to enjoy it at all since we had busy days and were frequently not back to the hotel until at least 9-10. Additional costs to factor in are parking and WiFi as neither are free to hotel guests.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,Super location!  Close to everything either by walking or the Victoria Square Metro.  Nice place with all the amenities.  Super friendly and polite staff. Very helpful when needed.  Bartender was a lot of fun. Nice little park across the street for people watching. About 4 blocks to the music fests. Shopping restaurants anything you want to do is easy to get to. Recommended?  I would stay there again so YES!

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,Disappointed in this hotel - not on par with other Intercontinentals. Lap pool deck was dirty, for a family of four the maid kept leaving only one bath towel, did not replenish coffee or bath products in room. The rug and drawers were dirty. One concierge was great, the other was slow and did not provide good recommendations. Location is great but for the price we were truly disappointed.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,Internet is terrible. Just shuts off leaving you with phone charges you probably aren't expecting... 
Late night menu is terrible if they even have anything. 
Bar closes too early. 
Room service is way too expensive for what little you get.
What's the point of staying here when there are better hotels for the same price around the corner?
 - This place could be great but they don't seem to care about the customer here.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,From the moment we stepped out of our cab we received excellent service. We checked in easily and the clerk even too the time to give us directions to the restaurant that we were going to later that night because the concierge was on break. The hotel conspired with my husband to deliver a slice of cheesecake to our room for our wedding anniversary. When we come back to Montreal, we will definitely stay at this hotel.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,This hotel was fantastic!!
Excellent value for the price.
I could not believe how attentive and helpful the front reception staff were. They went out of their way to prepare our room for us early and made sure that I had a hypoallergenic bed as requested and even double checked to make sure it was all executed correctly. The concierge was also helpful and able to direct us to various locations as needed.

I would recommend taking a walk around the adjoining Victoria square on the lower level. It's full of shops, restaurants and a must see fountain area. The Sarah B absinth bar was also a pleasure. We enjoyed some lovely cocktails and wine on several occasions. If you are looking for some fine dining, the Toqué restaurant across the street was named best restaurant in Canada. It's not cheap but should definitely be on your bucket list. I  would definitely stay at this hotel again.

The only improvement that I might suggest for this hotel would be to eliminate the perfume scent in the main lobby. It is extremely strong and assaulting to the senses for one with allergies! It made me feel quite sick actually. For this I deduct 1 star.

Montreal, QC H2Y 3X4,InterContinental Montreal,This place was a great find! Was in Montreal with a few friends last month and we were so happy with this place. Modern, elegant decor throughout the whole hotel. The service was great, and best of all, we ended up paying less than we were expecting. The view of the city from our room was stunning. The room was very quiet, clean, and upscale. The absinth bar was interesting and a good place to go for a drink without leaving the hotel. Free wifi. In a location convenient to Vieux-Port. I would absolutely stay here again.

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,My wife is from Poland...so when we checked into this cute restaurant in Old Montreal, she felt like she had been shipped back to Krakow upon entering.

My wife has me hooked on borscht, and I have become quite the borscht snob. I have had beat soup from her mother and from a Greenpoint restaurant. So when I tasted this version, I looked up at my equally disappointed wife. It was as if they had just made some powdered beat soup they picked up from a local supermarket.

We were then given some pierogies, and score! They made up for the soup, with some deliciously made pierogies. We then had a few Polish beers to end a decent dining experience.

It is family run and the waiters were from Poland. They even had a strong accent and spoke the language to my wife.

Very cute place...loses 2 points for the awful soup, and at times slow service.

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,Mmm...Polish food.  Stash is a great place to try Polish food.  The cuisine has both simple dishes (prepared to taste anything but simple or boring) for the timid eater like pierogi or pork chops as well as dishes that pack a wallop of flavor like zurek (sour soup) or bigos (stew with meat and sour cabbage).

Friendly service and tasty food.

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,Good place to learn about Polish food.

I came here on a random tip from a tour book and it was alright. I got the cabbage and sausage stew, which was tasty, but a bit salty. It would have went well with beer. I'd definitely get it again. For dessert, our server recommended potato pancakes... which was so weird. The only thing that made it remotely a dessert was the applesauce dip. Good experience though.

Tips: Good place to try Polish foods.

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,A lucky find in Montreal. We were walking by and saw this place. It looked interesting and we liked the menu.
Borsch was bad since it tasted as if it was from a can. But holidnik, golubci and the rest was incredibly tasty. Atmosphere was warm and welcoming! Staff was courteous and attentive. All the food was delicious and fresh (except for borsch).

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,We discovered this place on a previous trip to Montreal, and it was on our list of places to eat when we returned to the city this past week. We got 3 big plates to share: potato pancakes with sour cream, a mixture of cabbage and cheese pierogies, and a pancake "thing" filled with mushrooms. It was all SO good. We had our 3 year old with us, so we couldn't linger and really enjoy the food like we wanted to. We had some potato pancakes left over, and we took them back to the hotel to maybe eat later on. They were ice cold when I finally got to them, but I didn't care. I still ate them.

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,My brother, his girlfriend, and I happened upon this restaurant after getting a recommendation from another restaurant down the street (this first place was not open for lunch). It turned out to be a great recommendation! First, walking in, the decor was really nice. Red lights, heavy wood tables, bench seats, and pop-art hanging on the walls and from the ceilings. We were only the second group in the place, so we did not experience the slow service of other reviewers. Our server was very attentive, seemed to be in a great mood, and knew her beer! 

We started with two order of the mixed perogies, which were brought out right away. Our server recommended that we order them first and then see if we were still hungry. Being generally a hungry bunch, we ordered more. I ordered the mielony, my brother's girlfriend ordered the cabbage rolls, and my brother ordered the schnitzl (excuse my spelling, not sure if it's correct). We shared a bit and everything was delicious. Overall great experience and I'll probably go back.

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,We weren't actually aiming for Stash, but the restaurant down the block was closed mid-afternoon and we were quite hungry.  What a lucky stop!

First - good, prompt service - and they put up with us pronouncing the food names very poorly (except for the pierogis).  We had pierogis and the sweet cream crepes for entrees.  The portions were GREAT.  The pierogis were tender and flavorful - great with the sour cream.  The sweet cream crepes were a great surprise.  I don't know what I was expecting, but they were more savory than sweet - at least until the awesome fruit sauce was added.  Great afternoon meal.

Decent belgian beer selection as well.  Definitely will visit again in Montreal.

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,We picked this restaurant because it had wide open windows (on a beautiful evening) and had a piano player.  The menu offered three choices for complete meals... a Polish sampler type feast, fish (filet of sole, I think) and roast wild boar.  The meals included borsht, a green salad, entre, dessert and coffee.

The borsht was basically a beef consume flavored with beet.  It was served with sour cream.  Not like any borsht I've ever had, but not too bad.

The salad came with a house dressing to compliment the lettuce (only lettuce) hence the "green" description.

The Polish sampler plate was tasty and satisfying.  The roast wild boar was so dry and tough, it was nearly inedible.  According to the waiter, "wild boar has a different texture than pork" (apparently a shoe leather texture!).  I left all but  the first bite for the garbage bin.

The dessert was an apple strudel and was very good.  My wife asked to substitute the poppyseed cake ($1 more) for the strudel.  The waiter  agreed to do it at no extra charge since "I didn't like my entre".  Honestly... the strudel was a much better choice!

Clearly the most memorable part of the evening was the talented piano player who effortlessly turned Pink Floyd, Blackeyed Peas and other favorites into "elevator music".

Next time, we'll probably stop in just for dessert, coffee and piano.

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,Who would have thought that something as oddly named as "borsh"  could send your tastebuds to heaven. It's sharp cutting sweet flavor mellowed by the rich ultra fresh soured cream. Only something as simple as a salad could follow that flavor else your tastebuds might be broken.
   After a quick break of salad, their tour de force plate of wild boar, pickled sweet cabbage, and rough cut potatoes arrives and fills your mouth with such warmth that you begin to think that it's the kind of place where even a crying baby can put a smile on your face as you think about how wonderful and beautiful life is.
  After polishing off the main course reality is slowly brought back with a sliver of delicate hazelnut cake and a rich coffee which soothes the soul after such an experience. 
  Ahhh......thank god for good food.

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,Wow.

My husband and I went to Old Towne yesterday and saw this little gem, but I had already agreed we'd pay homage to HIS heredity and have Phó (that review is also included!).  But, we tucked this in the back of our minds and I'm glad we did!

The staff was an extremely pleasant woman who was fluent in English, Polish, and French.  She was sweet, attentive, and knew the city like the back of her hand.  She recommended our vodka and suggested to accompany it with apple juice, a "chaser" if you will.  She said it was "how the Polish do it", so why not?  When in Rome.....It was smooth, strong, and I felt content immediately.  The turpentine aftertaste (all vodka does to me, regardless of brand, but some better than others!) was immediately quashed by the sweetness of the juice.  I will never drink vodka any other way hereafter!

I am an embarrassment to my Polish and Irish heritage - I hate cabbage (!) - so I went with the pierogies.  Cheese.  My husband was easily swayed into the  gobki.

My dish came artfully arranged with a sprinkle of dill, a heaping side of sauerkraut and carrot shaped into a rosette.  My husband's order was accompanied by a cucumber/dill sauce mix and sliced boiled potatoes.

The pierogies tasted like my Babçi came back to life and got work in their kitchen.  Very authentic.  Dipped in the side bowl of sour cream, it was delicious!

My husband inhaled his dish (and half of mine) within seconds, which usually is a sign he likes it.  The gobki appeared to have an abundance of ground meat, which is a nice change from the rice-laden  cabbage rolls I usually see.  He stated the tomatoes were an excellent topping, as it was a bit dry inside of the roll.  He found the cucumber/dill muxture to be divine.  Not his words, but "wicked good" isn't exactly poetry, but a good description nonetheless!

The ambience is divine and the bar nicely stocked.  (side note: the building's side door also gives access to bathrooms without going through the restaurant). Our waitress informed us live music is usually at the restaurant nightly of we wanted to cone back for dessert and Polish coffee (coffee with vodka....of course!)

The menu may have been simple and don't offer a huge array of options, but sometimes that can be overwhelming.  So points today for simplicity.

If you are a fan of Polish food - this is authentic as it gets.  A MUST when in Montreal and desire something different than American and after a few days in Quebec, something different than French!

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,While on Montreal for business for a few days and staying in the old town, I have bumped into this traditional polish restaurant for a casual dinner.

This is an old school classic eastern european restaurant that has lots of tradition and less novelty. 

The food now, what can I say? good borsh (sour beet soup), really good pierogi (which is the polish equivalent for ravioli), an excellent polish sausage and some mighty fine polish and Lithuanian beer were sampled.

bottom line: everything was good and service was great!

The atmosphere is very warm, the owners and the people who work there all speak polish, French and English. the place is very warm and features live piano on evenings.

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,Great place - agree with the other reviewers. We had Borsch soup and the only thing to comment on was that we thought it should have had some chunks of actual beets
My wife had the Golabki (cabbage rolls) and loved it. I had the Pierogi and found it excellent. That and two glasses of Chopin vodka and St Ambroise beer topped it off. By the way, the piano player was enjoyable. The only sour note was our waitress who either had an attitude or ....

The other tables had a waiter who really seemed to go out of his way to please and explain the dishes - wish we had him

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,My mother in law would laugh at the portion sizes and what they charge for them.  With that being said, the food is absolutely authentic and delicious.  We had the pierogi, sausage, and golabki with sides of sauerkraut, potato salad and beet salad.  

The atmosphere was very good and the waiter and hostess were very friendly. 

The bathroom is up this windy staircase so hold off on the alcohol or hold off on the peeing.

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,Finally, Good food in Montreal. I was looking for good polish food and decided to try Stash Cafe. Very nice restaurant. There is a piano player and the ambiance is very relaxing. We ordered cabbage rolls, pork chop and pirogi. All we super good. Being from California, we never eat sauerkraut because it tastes terrible.  Many of the dishes came with sauerkraut and it was FANTASTIC. They make their own and it was the perfect compliment to the meal. Make sure to get dessert also. :-)

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,They serve the kind of food you only get in people's homes. It's not fancy restaurant food by any means, just solid stews and such. I keep thinking back to the dishes and how I can recreate them at home.

Rich dishes (try the post-hunt pork and cabbage stew). Really friendly service. One of my favorites in Montreal. Surprising to find reasonable and good food in the touristy area.

The food was great and tasted very fresh, I know my fair share about Polish/East European food and I have to say a lot of places don't do it justice, this  place does, so that's saying a lot and for a fair price. This is a place you should surely check out in you're in the area. Yum!

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,This was a real find, courtesy of the young woman at the reception of the Auberge Bonaparte. Cafe Stash features excellent Polish food; pierogi, sausage and sauerkraut, hunters stew, and a variety of other specialties. Décor is Polish lodge, and service very fast. I highly recommend Café Stash for lunch or dinner in Old Montreal.   This is a moderately priced restaurant.

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,On the plus side, Stash Cafe has nice ambiance and excellent service. I loved the piano player. He had a wicked sense of humor and played some very interesting melodies such as David Bowie's Major Tom and lots of old TV themes and hits from the 80s.

The food unfortunately was just average. We had their wild boar special and it was a little over cooked with way too much sauce.  Maybe this was an off night for the chef.

Will definitely give this place another try when I am back in Montreal. May stick to the simpler polish dishes like pirogi and sausage next time.

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,I cannot recommend Stash Cafe enough to friends, family, strangers!  Just ignore the fact that Rachel Ray also loves it.

Located in Old Montreal (Vieux-Montréal), this old world Polish restaurant serves up deliciously large plates of weiner schnitzel, peirogi, potato pancakes, pan seared fish, etc.  My weiner schnitzel (veal) was the size of my big head, pounded thin and fried up crisp and buttery.  The sides with it were shredded pickled beets (sweet and tart) and large, buttery wedges of potato.  My companion had pan seared white fish.  There were three very large and meaty fillets, fried up crisp and buttery.  Sides included the potato wedges and a fresh salad with creamy dressing.

A lot of people ordered the poppy seed cake, but we were too stuffed to indulge.

Montreal, QC H2Y 1Z9,Stash Café,I've been coming here regularly for 4 years.  The food is great at lunch or dinner.  Try the krokiety, you won't be disappointed.  I've been there for informal business lunches, meetups with friends, and candlelit dinners serenaded by their pianist.  One of the best restaurants in town for the location, ambiance, and food.
